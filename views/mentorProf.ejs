            <p>Thank you for enrolling as a mentor!</p>
            <p>Awsar connects every woman in India who is facing violence with legal and counseling help for free. </p>

            <p>We know how hard it is for a survivor of violence to break the silence and seek help, especially when the violence occurs within the 4 walls of home. The emotionally draining process of searching for help, the monetary costs that it can incur, and the fear of having to reveal oneâ€™s identity are only some of the many challenges survivors face. Many remain silent in the face of such daunting hurdles.</p>

            <p>But we believe that every woman should have easy, safe and free access to help so that she can lead a happy, healthy and just life free of violence. We work around the clock to find the most appropriate professional counsellor or lawyer for the survivor.</p> 
            <p>We believe that you can contribute to the growth and upliftment of women around you.</p>
            <p>Please begin your journey by filling your details in DETAILS tab.</p>
            <p>We will get back to you for contribution as soon as possible</p>
